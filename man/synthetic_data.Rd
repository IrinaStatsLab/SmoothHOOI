\title{
Generation of simulated data
}
\description{
Generate simulated ABPM data of 24(hours)*3(DBP, SBP, HR)*p(sample size) when the following information is available. Can define sample size (p), noise level, missing pattern, and missing rate.  
}
\usage{
synthetic_data(L, R, mean_G, cov_G, E, p, noise_level, pattern, percent)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{L}{
  A known matrix L of dimension a*r1. 
}
  \item{R}{
  A known matrix R of dimension b*r2. 
}
  \item{mean_G}{
  A known vector of mean values for G scores.
}
  \item{cov_G}{
  A known matrix for the covariance of G scores.  
}
  \item{E}{
  A known array E of dimension a*b*n, containing the empirical errors.
}
  \item{p}{
  Sample size. Should be an integer. 
}
  \item{noise_level}{
  Noise level. Should be greater than or equal to 0.
}
  \item{pattern}{
  Missing pattern. Can be either "random" or "structured".
}
  \item{percent}{
  Percent of data to be set to missing, if pattern = "random". Should be a number in [0,1).
}
